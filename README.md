# Insurance-Claim-Prediction


  An insurance policy is an agreement between a company and a customer by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee of compensation for specified loss, damage 
  or illness in return for the payment of a specified premium. A premium is a sum of money that the customer needs to pay regularly to an insurance company for this 
  guarantee.

  For example, you pay a premium of Rs. 3000/- each year for car insurance with a coverage of Rs. 100,000/-. Unfortunately, in case of an accident, the car is severely 
  damaged. In that case, the insurance provider company will bear the cost of damage etc. for up to Rs. 100,000. 

  Now if you are wondering how can a company bear such a high cost when it charges a premium of only Rs. 3000/- per year only i.e. where the concept of probability 
  comes into the picture. For example, there might be thousands of customers who would be paying a premium of Rs. 3000 every year just like you, but only a few of them 
  (say 2-3) would have had an accident that year and not everyone. This way everyone shares the risk of everyone else.
